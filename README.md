#  Ciphertext Decryption in C 
Amanda Falke 2014

OVERVIEW: Decrypt Ciphertext to plaintext in C IA32 using bit manipulation,
no string ASCII manipulation.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Hard code username.

2. Program takes one argument: ciphertext.txt

3. Take in ciphertext.txt through argv, and read file using fread, fseek, ftell, and
related functions.

4. Do not use string libraries, because NULL bytes are part of this process.

5. Decrypt file " username " and change file name to ciphertext.txt
